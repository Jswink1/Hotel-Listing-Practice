This is a practice API that simulates an API serving data about Hotels and their address location.

Concepts that I have learned and implemented into this API are:

- Logging (using Serilog)
- Global Error Handling
- Entity Framework Core
- Database Seeding
- Repository Pattern
- Parameter Binding (Route parameters, Uri/Query Parameters, and Request Body parameters)
- CORS Policy
- AutoMapper
- Data-Transfer Objects
- Http Response Types
- Versioning
- Caching
- Rate Limiting
